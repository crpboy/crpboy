## About me

- 🌱 I am curious about: operating system observability, eBPF technique, embedded operating system.
- ⚒️ Projects during my college years:
  - ✨ [NoAxiom](https://github.com/NoAxiom): A rust-based operating system kernel, featuring with stackless async-await runtime design and well-designed HAL layer. It has won the first prize in CSCC OS kernel competition.
  - ✨ [NoAXI LoongArch CPU](https://github.com/NoAXI/NoAXI-LoongArch-CPU): A FPGA CPU design for LoongArch architecture, written in modern RTL chisel(scala). It has won the second prize in NSCSCC 2024.
